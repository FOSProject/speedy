# Speedy

**Speedy** is a data serialisation format, intended to be as simple as possible. Unlike formats such as JSON and Atom, Speedy is designed to be used in every situation possible, while still being easy to read.

Currently, Speedy supports:

* Strings
* Numbers
* Boolean values
* Null values
* Nested data
* Comments

with more data types to follow in the future.
